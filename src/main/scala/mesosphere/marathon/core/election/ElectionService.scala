/**
  * ElectionService is implemented by leadership election mechanisms.
  *
  * This trait is used in conjunction with [[ElectionCandidate]]. From their point of view,
  * a leader election works as follow:
  *
  * -> ElectionService.offerLeadership(candidate)     |      - A leader election is triggered.
  *                                                          â€” Once `candidate` is elected as a leader,
  *                                                            its `startLeadership` is called.
  *
  * Please note that upon a call to [[ElectionService.abdicateLeadership]], or
  * any error in any of method of [[ElectionService]], or a leadership loss,
  * [[ElectionCandidate.stopLeadership]] is called if [[ElectionCandidate.startLeadership]]
  * has been called before, and JVM gets shutdown.
  *
  * It effectively means that a particular instance of Marathon can be elected at most once during its lifetime.
